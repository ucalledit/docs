---

The Totalis API uses API keys for authentication. API keys work for both REST API calls and WebSocket connections.

## Getting Your API Key

Generate an API key from the [Totalis Dashboard](https://app.totalis.trade):

1. Log in to [app.totalis.trade](https://app.totalis.trade)
2. Navigate to your account settings
3. Create a new API key and give it a name
4. Copy the full key immediately — it is only shown once

<Warning>
  The full API key is only displayed at creation time. Save it securely — you will not be able to retrieve it later.
</Warning>

## Using Your API Key

Send your API key in the `UCALLEDIT_API_KEY` header with every request:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.totalis.trade/rfqs \
  -H "UCALLEDIT_API_KEY: api_live_abc123def456ghi789"
```

For WebSocket connections, authenticate after connecting:

```json
{
  "type": "auth",
  "api_key": "api_live_abc123def456ghi789"
}
```

## Key Format

| Component | Example | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Prefix | `api_live_` | Environment indicator (`live` or `test`) |
| Secret | `abc123def456...` | Random secret portion |
| Full key | `api_live_abc123def456ghi789` | Complete key for authentication |

## Managing API Keys

You can list your existing API keys programmatically:

- **List keys** — `GET /user/api-keys`

To create or revoke keys, use the [Totalis Dashboard](https://app.totalis.trade).

## Key Lifecycle

- **Active** — Key is valid and can be used for authentication
- **Revoked** — Key has been manually revoked and will be rejected
- **Expired** — Key has passed its expiration date
